<h1> HANNIBAL- THE BATTLE OF CANNAE </h1>
<p>
After defeating the Romans at the Battle of Lake Trasimene, Hannibal now moved his forces down south. There was panic in Rome and Quintus Fabius Maximus was appointed dictator to deal with Hannibal. Fabius, however refused to meet Hannibal in the open and this strategy became highly unpopular in Rome. Romans were used to attacking, not hiding. The Romans were forced to go on the offensive after Hannibal posted his forces between Rome and it's vital grain supply. This setup the epic Battle of Cannae. Here Hannibal defeated the Romans inflicting thw worst single day defeat in Rome's history.
</p>
<h1> AFTERMATH OF THE BATTLE OF CANNAE </h1>
<p>
After the horrific defeat at the Battle of Cannae, the Romans reinstituted Fabius' avoidance strategy. The Romans no longer refused to meet Hannibal in head on collisions.
